Sample rate converter (SRC) Setup Tools
=======================================

This is a tool to set up SRC conversions sample rates list, define
quality related parameters, and test the C implementation for a number
of objective audio quality parameters.

The tools need GNU Octave version 4.0.0 or later with octave-signal
package.

src_2stage.m
============

Creates the header files to include to C into directory "include". A
report of create modes is written to directory "reports". The
coefficients need to be copied to directory
sof.git/src/include/reef/audio/coefficients/src.

The default quality of SRC is defined in module src_param.m. The
quality impacts the complexity and coefficents tables size of SRC.


src_test.m
==========

Tests dynamic range (DR) in dB(CCIR-RMS), frequency response (FR) as
+/- dB for a bandwidth, and does a sine wave chirp spectrogram plot to
visualize SRC characteristic like aliasing.

This tool helps to find out a suitable quality vs. complexity tradeoff.

An executable "src_test" need to be present in this directory. The
compilation assumes that the FW build directory sof.git is parallel to
this directory soft.git. The SRC coefficients are included from the
SRC coefficients files location
sof.git/src/include/reef/audio/coefficients/src

The compilation of the 32 bit C test bench requires in 64 bit Ubuntu
packages libc6-dev-amd64 and lib32gcc-6-dev.
