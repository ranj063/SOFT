function iir_resp = eq_iir_blob_resp(eq_b, eq_a)

%% Convert IIR coefficients to 2nd order sections and quantize
%
%  iir_resp = eq_iir_blob_resp(b, a, bits)
%
%  b - numerator coefficients
%  a - denominator coefficients
%  bits - number of bits to quantize
%
%  iir_resp - vector to setup an IIR equalizer with number of sections, shifts,
%  and quantized coefficients
