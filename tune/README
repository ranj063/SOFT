Running make in the root directory in sound-open-firmware-tools should build the tune directory and the testbench along with it.

Please make sure to include the SOF install directory in the prefix while running configure if not using default directory for installation.

Set up the command line arguments and invoke the testbench using the included "run_testbench.sh" script.

Testbench supports both text and raw input file formats

Known Limitations:

1. Testbench set up to work with simple volume topologies only currently.

2. Please keep same file format for input and output files
